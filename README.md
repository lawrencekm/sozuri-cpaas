## Admin Dashboard & System Management

### Overview
The admin dashboard provides comprehensive system administration capabilities including user management, account impersonation, and large-scale log downloads. This feature is designed for system administrators and support teams who need quick access to user accounts and system diagnostics.

### Quick Start for Admins

1. **Access Secure Admin Dashboard**: Navigate to `/admin` (removed from main navigation for security)
2. **User & Project Management**: View all users, their projects, and credit balances
3. **Credit Management**: Top-up user credits with real-time balance updates
4. **Account Impersonation**: One-click access to any user account for support
5. **System Log Management**: Download system logs in bulk
6. **User Log Access**: Users can access personal logs at `/dashboard/logs`

### User Management Features

#### Secure Admin Dashboard (`/admin`)
- **User Overview**: Real-time statistics (Total Users, Active Projects, Total Credits, Active Users, Suspended)
- **Project Management**: View all projects across all users with status and balance tracking
- **Credit Management**: Top-up user credits with transaction tracking
- **Advanced Search**: Filter users by name, email, role, or company
- **Role Management**: View and manage user roles (Admin, User)
- **Account Status**: Monitor active, inactive, and suspended accounts
- **One-Click Impersonation**: Instantly access any user account for support
- **Security**: Admin routes removed from main navigation, accessible only via direct URL

### Account Impersonation System

#### How It Works
1. **Start Impersonation**: Click the impersonate button next to any user
2. **Secure Session**: System creates a secure impersonation token
3. **Full Access**: Experience the platform exactly as the user would
4. **Easy Exit**: One-click return to your admin account

#### Security Features
- **Admin-Only Access**: Only users with admin permissions can impersonate
- **Audit Trail**: All impersonation sessions are logged
- **Session Management**: Secure JWT token handling
- **Protection**: Prevents admin-to-admin impersonation for security

#### Usage Example
```javascript
// Start impersonating a user
POST /api/auth/impersonate
{
  "userId": "user_123"
}

// Stop impersonation and return to admin account
POST /api/auth/stop-impersonation
```

### Log Management & Downloads

#### Bulk Log Download (`/dashboard/admin/logs`)
- **Large Scale**: Successfully handles 1-2M+ log entries
- **Multiple Formats**: JSON, CSV, and TXT export options
- **High Performance**: 6+ MB/s download speeds tested
- **Advanced Filtering**: Date range, log level, source, and text search

#### Log Filtering Options
```
 Date Range: Filter logs by specific time periods
 Log Levels: Debug, Info, Warning, Error, Fatal
Text Search: Search across messages, sources, and user IDs
Sources: API, Auth, Messaging, Webhooks, Chat, Analytics
User Filter: Filter by specific user activities
```

#### Download Performance

### üß™ Testing Admin Functionality

A test script is included to verify all admin functionality:

```bash
# Run the admin functionality test
node test-admin-functionality.js
```

Expected output:
```
üß™ Testing Admin Functionality...

1. ‚úÖ Users API: 5 users found
2. ‚úÖ User API: Found user John Doe
3. ‚úÖ Impersonation API: Now impersonating Jane Smith
4. ‚úÖ Logs API: 50 logs found (Total: 2000)
5. ‚úÖ Log Download API: Downloaded 41MB+ of JSON data
6. ‚úÖ Large Download Test: Downloaded 12.01MB in 1.894s
   Performance: 6.34 MB/s

üéâ All tests passed! Admin functionality is working correctly.
```

### üîí Security & Permissions

#### Access Control
- **Role-Based**: Only users with 'admin' role can access admin features
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Permission Validation**: Server-side permission checks on all endpoints
- **Audit Logging**: All admin actions are logged for compliance

#### Best Practices
1. **Regular Audits**: Review admin access logs regularly
2. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant admin access only when necessary
3. **Session Management**: Impersonation sessions have appropriate timeouts
4. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for admin activities

Environment Variables
Create a .env.local file with the following variables:
```
API Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-api-domain.com/api

Authentication
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-nextauth-secret

Service Provider API Keys
SMS_API_KEY=your-sms-api-key
WHATSAPP_API_KEY=your-whatsapp-api-key
VIBER_API_KEY=your-viber-api-key
RCS_API_KEY=your-rcs-api-key
VOICE_API_KEY=your-voice-api-key

Database (if using direct database connection)
DATABASE_URL=your-database-connection-string

Updated Installation Steps

# New dependencies
npm install @tanstack/react-query @tanstack/react-query-devtools \
  pino pino-pretty react-error-boundary

## Error Handling Architecture

The application implements a robust error handling system:

1. **Error Boundary Components**
   - Hierarchical error boundaries to contain errors
   - Application-level error boundary in `ErrorProvider`
   - Component-specific error boundary for isolated error handling

2. **Centralized Error Management**
   - All errors flow through `lib/error-handler.ts` for consistent handling
   - Errors are properly tagged and categorized for better analysis
   - Custom error severity levels for prioritizing issues

Monitoring & Observability

1. Health Checks & Diagnostics

// Implemented health checks
export async function healthCheck() {
  const [apiHealth, dbHealth] = await Promise.all([
    fetch('/api/health'),
    checkDatabaseConnection()
  ])

  return {
    status: apiHealth.ok && dbHealth ? 'healthy' : 'degraded',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    dependencies: {
      api: apiHealth.status,
      database: dbHealth ? 'connected' : 'disconnected'
    }
  }
}

Added health check endpoints for all services
Implemented system diagnostics for troubleshooting
Created a status dashboard for monitoring system health

2. Analytics & Metrics

Implemented comprehensive analytics tracking
Added performance metrics for all key operations
Created dashboards for monitoring user engagement
Implemented real-time analytics for messaging performance

3. AI-Powered Insights
